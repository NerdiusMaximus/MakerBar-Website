It's About Time: The Hackathon: The Blog Post

What's February about at the MakerBar? <strong>IT'S ABOUT TIME!</strong> In the literal sense, we're making some astoundingly high-tech clocks. In the figurative sense, we're kicking our hack-crastination habit and gittin'* things done! That's why we want YOU at our upcoming event...

<strong>It's About Time: The Hackathon</strong><span style="line-height: 13px;">!</span>

Between 7:00 Friday, 2/XX and 7:00 Sunday, 2/XX, we invite all hackers to bring and finish a shelved project, because It's About Time you do! We're keeping the space open all weekend and providing you with food, tools, and caffeine to eliminate all excuses! Haven't made time to visit the space? It's About Time you get over here and see what the MakerBar is about!

In the workshop, the space will be fully operational all weekend long. You'll have our newly-refurbished machine shop and the 3D printer ready to rock, and our parts and salvage libraries are open for your use. You'll find a Raspberry Pi set up so that the moment you conquer that milestone, you can post it straight to Hackaday and get famous!

In the lounge, we'll have food cooked by members and order in. We're psyched about <strong>John's Hacked Bison Chili</strong>**, made with the help of sous chef Aurora! We'll also screen a time-themed movie, to remind you about <em>the precious moments of lifetime you'll never get back while your project languishes on a shelf as you watch a movie, and how everyone else will finish their projects and beam with pride while all you have is your shame.</em><strong> </strong>And so you can take a break, too.

Drop in any time, and punch out any time. No project? No excuses! We'll help you select and start one!

This event is free and open to everyone, even nonmembers, especially members of other hackerspaces! Alpha One, Resistor NYC, FUBAR, IXR, Make.SI, Hack Manhattan? It's About Time you see what we hath wrought in Hoboken! I know you set Google Alerts on the names of your hackerspace, so do we! You can come too, Third Ward.

BYOB drinking strongly encouraged.

*Like the open-source version control system! See what I did there?

**The chili itself is hacked. We don't yet have the facilities to hack bison pre-chili. Perhaps Genspace can give us some tips.
