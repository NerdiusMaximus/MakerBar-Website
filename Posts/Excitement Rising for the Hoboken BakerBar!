Fresh from a wildly successful fundraising event, we're proud to announce the launch of our sister organization, the Hoboken Bakerbar!

The BakerBar is the Garden State's first bakerspace, a communal kitchen for casual cooks and aspiring <em>p√¢tissiers </em>to learn and experiment. Through the efforts of Bake Magazine and Baker Faire, as well as startups like Adafruitcake and Sparkdough, the Baker Movement has rapidly become the toast of the media. The BakerBar will bring the magic of DIY pastry to Hoboken, the city of Carlo's and cannoli, in an accessible and fun community center.

To house the new organization, BakerBar founders have leased a 1,100-square-foot extension to the historic Neumann Leathers building on Observer Highway. Over the next three weeks, volunteers will work around the clock, tearing up rotted beams, restoring the parquetry floor, and installing industrial kitchen equipment donated by Hoboken businesses. The end result will feature two large work tables, a lounge/dining room, a shop stocked with dough hooks, rolling pins, and mixing bowls, and dry ingredient storage.

Just $100 per month gains a BakerBar member 24/7 access to the kitchen, free classes, and a dedicated oven rack. Nonmembers are free to participate in two free open events each week - Frosting Wednesday, where participants can purchase custom BakerBar recipe kits; and Friday Bake Night, where our equipment is open for free use. In addition, members share their skills in exciting classes, including:
<ul>
	<li>Learn Ganache the Hard Way - Follow the challenging online glazing course with help from BakerBar members. This popular teach-yourself-icing class doesn't cut corners; you need to chop your own chocolate and regulate your own temperature, no pre-made ingredients allowed!</li>
	<li>Phyllo for Organic Life-Forms - Get a hands-on crash course with the wildly popular dough in our introductory class! Phyllo is the base for countless pastry projects like cookies, pies, and even Beef Wellington. Even if you've never set an oven or defrosted a dough, you'll be baking in no time. Toppings kit included!</li>
	<li>Raspberry Pie Hack Day - Our favorite British import, Raspberry Pie is sweeping the nation! Learn how you can modify and use your Raspberry Pie. Install a new filling, experiment with alternative toppings, and decorate a custom box to bring home.</li>
</ul>
The BakerBar is set to open on April 20th due to massive community response. "My friends are all talking about 'getting baked' on 4/20," said MakerBar founder Zack Freedman. "I've never seen them cook before, so they must be ashamed to practice it openly. That's why I got behind the BakerBar project - everyone should feel comfortable doing their hobby, and have access to the skills and tools they need."

The MakerBar is Hoboken's hackerspace, a place for hackers of New Jersey and New York to gather and build incredible things. Members share skills and practice soldering, electronics, handicrafts, 3D printing, woodworking, rocketry, robotics, and more. A 501(c)3-pending nonprofit, the MakerBar's 16 members will celebrate the organization's first anniversary next month.
