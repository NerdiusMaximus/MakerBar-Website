MakerBar has had a lot of visitors in the few months we’ve been open. A few visitors have asked us if we were stamping hackerspace passports. We had an official logo at the time, but not a stamp. Also, when we hosted <a title="MakerBar Mitch Altman" href="http://blog.makerbar.com/?p=173">Mitch Altman</a> for his talk a few months ago, the creator of the hackerspace passport, we were embarrassed that we didn’t have a stamp. Zack quickly cut out a logo stencil out of transparency sheet and carefully sprayed the passports with spray paint. The results could be better, but at least they did leave Hoboken with one more stamp in their passport!

This will not happen again, because we now have our own stamp, everyone! So, make sure you get your passport stamped next time you're visiting MakerBar! If you don't have a hackerspace passport you can:

• Get your notebook stamped instead!
• Download the PDF <a title="NoiseBridge Passport" href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Passport">here</a> and print your own
• Buy a passport from SparkFun <a title="SparkFun " href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11079">here</a> for less than $2

Next time you’re going travelling, you might want to check the <a title="Hackerspaces" href="http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/List_of_Hacker_Spaces">list of hackerspaces</a> to see if there’s a place you can drop in and see what they’re up to. Nowadays, it’s getting harder and harder to find a city where there isn’t one. Woot!
