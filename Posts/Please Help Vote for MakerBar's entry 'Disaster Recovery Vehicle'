Our most recent collaborative project, and the one for which we are currently seeking support for our entry into the Make Magazine/Ford Vehicle Design Challenge here:

http://makezine.com/maker-vehicle-challenge/#view/19038/1651435

We are asking for your vote and support to help propel us into the final round (deadline tomorrow, December 12th - top 3 advance), and to push the D.R.V. into production for disaster recovery areas. We were all affected in one way or another by hurricane Sandy last year, and it seems clear that there is more to come; floods, earthquakes, tornado's, hurricanes, any natural (or unnatural) disaster really - this vehicle will be a critical asset in helping start the recovery effort for any community. Had this vehicle been available, it could have helped thousands of storm victims who lost power, running water, access to food, and phone/internet communications within hours or days of the storm, rather than weeks or months.

"The Ford Transit Disaster Relief Vehicle (DRV) is designed with the capability to provide sustained relief to disaster areas by providing warm food, clean water, shelter, communications/information exchange, and electricity. While not a first-responder vehicle, the DRV can supplement the abilities of first-responders, then stay on site for continued support."

Please take a moment and vote for our 'Disaster Recovery Vehicle' also check out our MakerBar blog, meetup, and facebook for future events and class schedules.
