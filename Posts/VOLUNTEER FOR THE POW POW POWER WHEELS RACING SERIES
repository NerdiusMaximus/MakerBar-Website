<div>MakerFaire is on the horizon, and that means the Power Racing Series Grand Finale is too! This is a competition (in the loosest sense of the word) where nerds from across the land, take plastic Power Wheels cars and trick them out to make them go really fast. Silliness ensues.  <a href="http://www.powerracingseries.org/" target="_blank">http://www.powerracingseries.org/</a></div>
<div>We here at the MakerBar have gotten our hands on this shiny FIRETRUCK!! WE NEED YOUR HELP!!!</div>

<div><span style="font-size: 13px">This will be the cut off date for MakerBar Power Wheels 2013. If we do not have enough volunteers by then… Well, we will have a very early start on the 2014 team!!</span></div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 13px">What are we doing? We are building an electric car based on a children’s toy firetruck (see above pic[s]) to race in the Maker Faire PowerRacing Series at Maker Faire 2013 on September 21-22 at New York Hall of Science, Queens, NY.  </span></div>

<div>Thank you to everyone that as joined in so far. MakerBar Membership (&lt;20) is stretched a little thin for this event (with the MakerBar table to host all weekend). We are gong to be heavily reliant on volunteers for our Power Wheels team.</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>At this point <b>we do not have enough volunteers</b> to finish the build or field a race team at MakerFaire 2013… so please sign up now and join the team.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span style="text-decoration: underline">Power Wheels Team:</span></div>
<div></div>
<div>We need at least 4 qualified/skilled leaders/workers/assistants for each of the four systems:</div>
<div>- POWER - electric system, motors, batteries, chargers, kill switch</div>
<div>- WHEELS - frame, wheels, steering, braking, seat attachment</div>
<div>- SAFTEY - steering wheel, seat, safety harness, brake controls, kill switch controls, Wheelie BAR!!!!!</div>
<div>- MOXIE - blingity-bling-bling, lights, siren, water canon, etc., numbers, moxie board tag (see rules), team flag</div>
<div></div>
<div>Even better would be 10-12 people with each one taking just one piece of the build.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Weekend of Maker Faire 9/20, 9/21, 9/22:</b></div>
<div><span style="font-size: 13px"> </span></div>
<div>? - Chief Mechanical Engineer</div>
<div>? - Asst Mechanic</div>
<div>? - Chief Power System Engineer</div>
<div>? - Battery Wrangler</div>
<div>? - Moxie Master</div>
<div>? - Moxie Muster</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also, we have to get a team member to be part-time help to run the races. You get a cool t-shirt. This would be best if it was one of the assistants. Cannot be the driver. or chief mechanic. (See rules.) We are looking for 7-8 people on the team. [But, with the right 5 very committed people we could get it done.] It really depends on people’s skills and availability.</div>
