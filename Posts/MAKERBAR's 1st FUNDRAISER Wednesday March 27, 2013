<p style="text-align: right">Come join this FUN event and support the MakerBar!</p>
<p style="text-align: right">The MakerBar is in the process of changing its IRS filing status to 501c3. Essentially this means that donations made to the organizatiom will be tax deductible after the filing has been processed and approved. This status will help the MakerBar evolve and ultimately allow us us to offer improved facilities, shop equipment and education opportunities to the MakerBar community.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Besides a mountain of paperwork (not fun) there's a hefty filing fee that needs to be paid (not fun). To help defray some of the expense, MakerBar is hosting it's first public Fundraiser (very fun!) at a beloved Hoboken waterfront bar and restaurant, <a title="Facebook Page" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheMeltingPotHoboken?rf=178244215565933" target="_blank">The Melting Pot</a>.</p>
