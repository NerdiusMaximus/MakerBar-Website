January 2013, the MakerBar teamed up with the Hoboken Public Library's Hoboken DIY series to offer a class the likes of which they've never seen - we taught them how to solder!

But the kits these brave Hobokenites soldered were no ordinary kits... they were custom kits made specially for them by MakerBar member Zack Freedman!

These special-edition kits solder together quickly and easily to create <strong>The Joule Thief, a flashlight that runs off of dead batteries!</strong> Did I mention that these flashlights are <em>really, really bright?</em> Because they are - far more powerful than any LED flashlight ought to be, even those that aren't using dead batteries as the power source!
