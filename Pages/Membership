Membership

MakerBar is run by members, for members, from members' dues and donations. If you're looking for a pressure-free home for your hobbies and a gathering ground of cool people ready to share their skills, consider becoming a MakerBar member!

Full members enjoy 24/7 access to the space with their own set of keys, a shelf to store projects and personal stuff, access to shared tools and parts, and free classes. They can bring guests along and participate in all MakerBar activities. Full membership dues are $100 per month.

Discounts are available as well. Student memberships are $100 per semester (four months) but do not include keys or storage space.

Members' dues support the MakerBar's activities, keeping our awesome space leased and lit! If you'd like to become a member, speak to any member at one of our open activities!
